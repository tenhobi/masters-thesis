\section{Aims and Objectives}

Gamification in education is a~noteworthy aid to educational games.
This thesis focuses on the~analysis, design, and development of a~prototype of such a~game
that focuses on teaching programming concepts.

Due to mentioned motivations, the~game is aimed primarily at young people, but this condition is not exclusive; everyone will be able to play the~game.
That means focusing on middle school or high school children, i.e., 11 to 18 years old.
Therefore, the~game must be simple, easy to understand, and the~mechanics shall be quick to master.

In order for the~game to be designed as best as possible, a~survey among children, parents, and teachers will be needed.
Based on the~survey and the~mentioned articles, an~analysis of the~requirements for the~game will be created.
Then the~game will be designed and implemented, and finally, usability testing will be performed and evaluated.
