\section{Evaluation}

As described in previous texts, most tasks were completed without any problems.
The assumption that not immediately displaying the game mission's description is a worse solution has been verified.
It was found that \mintinline{text}|size| and \mintinline{text}|speed| attributes are not self-describing, so their explanation has been added to the learning mission.
A critical error was also discovered in processing command blocks into the game's queue, which caused an endless loop.
This bug has been fixed.

Therefore, overall the results of usability testing are very positive.
The testers were able to complete the assigned tasks.
They mostly understood the meaning of everything, and everyone managed to complete the game mission.
Finding a critical error is also a good sign that user testing has paid off.
