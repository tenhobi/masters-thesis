\section{User Interface}
\label{design:ui}

In this section, a~design of wireframes will be discussed.

\subsection{Sign-In and Sign-Up Screens}

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/design/ui/wir_login.png}
    \caption{Sign-In Wireframe}
    \label{fig:design:wir:login}
\end{figure}

On the~screen will be one of the~important components~--- sign in and sign up, as can be seen in the~figure~\ref{fig:design:wir:login}.
If the~user does not register or log in, they cannot play the~game.
Therefore, it will be more than appropriate if the~screen is simple and contains a~meaningful design.

The~screen contains text inputs for entering nicknames, passwords, and more and includes a~button that is used to submit the~form.

\subsection{Missions Screen}

Missions screen~\ref{fig:design:wir:missions} is a~transition screen for selecting missions to play.
\linebreak
It contains a~top menu from which it is possible to access all stories, statistics, a~profile, and a~button on the~main page.

It contains an~overview of individual missions, tuned into a~linear sequence, but it is also possible to make a~divided linear sequence of missions.
A line is displayed between the~missions, indicating continuing to the~next mission.
Next to the~mission is its name.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Story Screen~--- Learning and Storytelling}

Like the~previous wireframe, in the~figure~\ref{fig:design:wir:story-learning} there is a~story screen which, after clicking on the~learning mission or storytelling mission, displays a~bubble dialog with information about the~learning mission or storytelling mission.
It contains information about the~title, description, and a~button to start a~learning or storytelling mission.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/design/ui/wir_story.png}
    \caption{Learning and Storytelling Missions Wireframe}
    \label{fig:design:wir:story-learning}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Story Screen~--- Game}

Story screen with click on a~game mission in the~figure~\ref{fig:design:wir:story-game}.
The~click will show a~bubble dialog that contains information about the~number of points completed, the~mission name, the~caption, and the~play button.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/design/ui/wir_game.png}
    \caption{Game Mission Wireframe}
    \label{fig:design:wir:story-game}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Game Screen}

The~main part of the~prototype of the~developed game is on the~screen~\ref{fig:design:wir:game-mission}.
It contains both a~top menu that includes buttons to jump to the~main screen, stories, statistics, and a~profile.

The~screen contains a~panel with command blocks on the~left.
These are arranged below each other and possibly nested inside each other.
To the~right of this is a~palette of commands that can be used for a~given mission.
Below these panels, there is a panel at the~bottom with buttons to save and stop the~game.

In the~right part of the~screen, there is a~grid display that represents the~game's current state.
The~grid can display walkable lungs or non-walkable squares that form walls or other types of obstacles.
The~grid also shows a~doll that marks the~robot, Karel.
That is the~character the~player is playing as.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/design/ui/wir_game_mission.png}
    \caption{Game Screen Wireframe}
    \label{fig:design:wir:game-mission}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Game Dialog}

Whether successful or not, a~dialog window will appear with a~status message at the~end of the~game, as can be seen in the~figure~\ref{fig:design:wir:game-dialog}.
This dialog reports whether the~game ended with an~error or successfully.
In addition, the~dialog contains a~caption.
The~optional size and speed bonus attributes are displayed if the~status is successful.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/design/ui/wir_game_dialog.png}
    \caption{Game Dialog Wireframe}
    \label{fig:design:wir:game-dialog}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistics Screen}

The~statistics screen~\ref{fig:design:wir:statistics} shows the~status of success of game missions and values of the~optional size and speed attributes.
It displays it in the~tabular form separately according to the player and other players.
The~statistics are divided according to the~game mission.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{assets/design/ui/wir_stats.png}
