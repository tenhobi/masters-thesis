\label{survey}

Surveys gather information through questions on a sample of people.
They can take many forms, including telephone surveys, face-to-face surveys, paper surveys, and online surveys.
Unlike other forms, online surveys benefit from being faster, cheaper, more accurate, and easy to get and analyze.

Online surveys often consist of open-ended and closed-ended questions that help analyze the studied topic.
They can also contain different questions based on participants' roles.
There are also dedicated applications to create and conduct online surveys that can set up different questions, separate them into individual groups or pages, make conditions to display them only to specific user roles, etc.

The first important task is defining the survey's goals and who to survey.
With that in mind, questions are created.
And in the end, the gathered data has to be analyzed.
It is often required to process and adjust the data before analyzing, especially the open-ended questions.
Therefore a human worker must go through these questions and take out the relevant data.
