\section{Functional Requirements}

For the context of this section, a not-signed user is called \textquote{a user}, and a signed user is called \textquote{a player}.
Moreover, a player can use all features a user can. 

Functional requirements describe individual requirements for the functionality of the game.
They describe actions or features users or players can use.
These requirements can be looked at as individual units, and they can form separate game modules.

Analysis of the game that is the base for requirements is described in more detail in section~\ref{analysis:game}.
Signing up, in, and out~-- as described in section~\ref{analysis:game:sign-up-in-out}~-- are crucial requirements that allow users to use the locked-in features of the game.
Looking up game information~-- as described in section~\ref{analysis:game:game-information}~-- is an essential feature that allows all types of users, users, and players, to get the available information like contacts, press data, and guidelines, terms of use, etc.
Players also might need to take a look at their profile of statistics~-- as described in sections~\ref{analysis:game:statistics} and~\ref{analysis:game:profile}.
The game provides several courses called stories and their missions.
Missions can be of different types: storytelling, learning, or game missions.
Courses and missions are widely described in section~\ref{analysis:game:stories-and-missions}, and game mission and all its features, in particular, are described in section~\ref{analysis:game:game-missions}.
Some additional features are also described as future development ideas in section~\ref{analysis:game:future-features}.
However, these features are not included in the list of functional requirements, as this list only contains features for the prototype that will be designed and implemented in the game.
